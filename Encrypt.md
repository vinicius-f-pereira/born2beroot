# Full guide to how to create an encrypted partition using LVM on Debian latest:**

## **Prerequisites:**

* Debian latest installed on your system
* The cryptsetup and lvm2 packages installed
* A backup of your existing data, if any

#

### **Steps:**

### 1. **Create an empty partition on your disk.** You can use a disk partitioning tool such as fdisk or GParted to do this.
### 2. **Format the partition as encrypted.** To do this, use the cryptsetup command:

```
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdxN
```

Replace `/dev/sdxN` with the device name of the partition you created in step 1.

#

### 3. **Enter a passphrase when prompted.** This passphrase will be used to encrypt and decrypt the partition. Be sure to choose a strong passphrase that is difficult to guess.
### 4. **Open the encrypted partition.** Once the partition is formatted, you need to open it before you can use it. To do this, use the cryptsetup command:

```
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdxN my_encrypted_partition
```

Replace `/dev/sdxN` with the device name of the encrypted partition and `my_encrypted_partition` with the name you want to give the unlocked partition.

#

### 5. **Create a volume group on the encrypted partition.** To do this, use the vgcreate command:

```
vgcreate my_volume_group /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition
```

Replace `my_volume_group` with the name you want to give the volume group.

#

### 6. **Create logical volumes on the volume group.** To do this, use the lvcreate command. For example, to create a logical volume for the root filesystem, you would use the following command:

```
lvcreate -n root -L 10G my_volume_group
```
#

Replace `root` with the name you want to give the logical volume and `10G` with the size of the logical volume in gigabytes.

#

### 7. **Format the logical volumes.** You can use any file system you want, but EXT4 is a good choice. To format a logical volume as EXT4, use the mkfs.ext4 command:

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_volume_group-root
```

Replace `/dev/mapper/my_volume_group-root` with the device name of the logical volume.

#

### 8. **Mount the logical volumes.** To do this, create a mount point for each logical volume and then use the mount command to mount the logical volume to the mount point. For example, to mount the root filesystem logical volume to the `/` directory, you would use the following commands:

```
mkdir /mnt/root
mount /dev/mapper/my_volume_group-root /mnt/root
```
#

### 9. **Install Debian on the encrypted partition.** Once the logical volumes are mounted, you can install Debian on the encrypted partition. To do this, follow the Debian installation instructions.
### 10. **Configure your system to boot from the encrypted partition.** Once Debian is installed, you need to configure your system to boot from the encrypted partition. To do this, edit the `/etc/crypttab` file. Add the following line to the file:

```
my_encrypted_partition /dev/sdxN luks
```

Replace `/dev/sdxN` with the device name of the encrypted partition and `my_encrypted_partition` with the name you gave the unlocked partition in step 4.

#

### 11. **Edit the `/etc/fstab` file.** Add the following line to the file to mount the root filesystem logical volume at boot time:

```
/dev/mapper/my_volume_group-root / ext4 defaults 0 0
```

Replace `/dev/mapper/my_volume_group-root` with the device name of the root filesystem logical volume.

#

### 12. **Reboot your system.** Your system will now boot from the encrypted partition.

#

## **Tips:**

* You can create multiple encrypted partitions on a single disk.
* You can use encrypted LVM partitions for any type of data, such as the root filesystem, home directory, or swap space.
* Be sure to backup your passphrase regularly. If you lose your passphrase, you will not be able to access your data.

# **Conclusion:**

By following the steps above, you can create an encrypted partition using LVM on Debian latest. This will help to protect your data from unauthorized access, even if your disk is lost or stolen.
